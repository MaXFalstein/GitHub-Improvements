# Gists

## A list of ideas relating to Gists for GitHub

### Corporate Gists

Gists are a great way of announcing news to collaborators, followers and the developer public on GitHub.

Currently, this appears to be missing for corporations.

I am unsure on the support for Enterprise, but I would love to see Corporate Gists.

### Labels and Milestones

I think there should be a setting in each Gist for it to be tied to Issues where it can be a Gist and an Issue, but synced across the two views.

This feature should enable adding labels and milestones to the Gist.
