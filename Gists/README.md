# Gists

## A list of ideas relating to Gists for GitHub

### Corporate Gists

Gists are a great way of announcing news to collaborators, followers and the developer public on GitHub.

Currently, this appears to be missing for corporations.

I am unsure on the support for Enterprise, but I would love to see Corporate Gists.

### Gists as Part of Repositories

I would like to be able to use a Gist as part of a repository because the Gist provides a great platform for updating users with more information for discussion compared to an issue.

I can add multiple files to a Gist, I can reference files in an Issue.

I like the idea of using both Gists and Issues with a repository.

GitHub.com repository top line would look like:

    | <> Code | (!) Issues | Gists | Pull Requests | Wiki | Pulse | Graphs | Settings |

This works well with the next idea, [Labels and Milestones](https://github.com/MaXwellFalstein/GitHub-Improvements/tree/master/Gists#labels-and-milestones)

### Labels and Milestones

I think there should be a setting in each Gist for it to be tied to Issues where it can be a Gist and an Issue, but synced across the two views.

This feature should enable adding labels and milestones to the Gist.
