# [GitHub](https://github.com) Improvements by [MaX Falstein](https://twitter.com/MaX_MSD)

This is the second generation repository. The original repository is [GitHub Labels and Milestenes in JSON](https://github.com/MaXwellFalstein/GitHub-Labels-Milestones-JSON).

I received an email from GitHub staff informing me GitHub would be very happy to listen / read any and all suggestions for improvements.

GitHub staff told me they loved the [original example GitHub repository (GitHub Labels and Milestenes in JSON)](https://github.com/MaXwellFalstein/GitHub-Labels-Milestones-JSON).

Because of the above, I created this repository to store all of my suggestions.

Please feel free to fork and create pull requests to suggest more improvements.
