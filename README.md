# GitHub Improvements from [MaX Falstein](https://twitter.com/MaX_MSD)

> ## *This repository is formed on top of my own repository, [GitHub Labels and Milestenes in JSON](https://github.com/MaXwellFalstein/GitHub-Labels-Milestones-JSON)*

---

I emailed GitHub to suggest implementing a JSON file in the .github configuration files for setting up the labels.

I have received emails from GitHub asking how I see this working. This is my file format suggestion for how it should look.

---

I received an email from GitHub staff informing me GitHub would be very happy to listen / read any and all suggestions for improvements.

GitHub staff told me they loved the example GitHub repository.

Because of the above, I created this repository to store all of my suggestions.
