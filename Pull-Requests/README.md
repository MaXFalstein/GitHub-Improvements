# Pull Requests

## Automatic Inline Pull Requests from Original Repository Changes for Any Forks

A little switch or a setting enabled in .git would allow the user to set whether they would like their forked repository to be automatically kept inline with the changes in the original repository.

This feature will not automatically add the files to the forked repository, it will add to an ever changing pull request.

This pull request will be from a hidden branch, named Fork, which will keep everything synced.

A second feature in the file in .git would be to enable the viewing of the hidden Fork branch.

The Fork branch will not be able to edited by anyone, it can only be viewed.
