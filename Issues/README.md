## GitHub Labels and Milestones in JSON

I emailed GitHub to suggest implementing a JSON file in the .github configuration files for setting up the labels.

I have received emails from GitHub asking how I see this working. This is my file format suggestion for how it should look.

To add to the labels.json file, I have created a milestones.json file.

It features everything I think it needs to be able to configure the milestones with ease.

A default template should be uploadable to the account holder's settings for the labels.json and milestones.json files to be set as defaults every time there is a new repository created by that account.

The same should be supported for Companies and Organisations.

## Issues Searchbar Added to GitHub New Issue Box Title

I would like to have the issue searchbar included when I type in the title for a new issue.

This will help make sure there are fewer duplicates of issues reported.

It will make large repository owners lives much easier with large amounts of duplicate issues being reported.
