## Labels and Milestones in JSON

I emailed GitHub to suggest implementing a JSON file in the .github configuration files for setting up the labels.

I have received emails from GitHub asking how I see this working. This is my file format suggestion for how it should look.

To add to the labels.json file, I have created a milestones.json file.

It features everything I think it needs to be able to configure the milestones with ease.

A default template should be uploadable to the account holder's settings for the labels.json and milestones.json files to be set as defaults every time there is a new repository created by that account.

The same should be supported for Companies and Organisations.

## Issues Searchbar Added to GitHub New Issue Box Title

I would like to have the issue searchbar included when I type in the title for a new issue.

This will help make sure there are fewer duplicates of issues reported.

It will make large repository owners lives much easier with large amounts of duplicate issues being reported.

## Issue Markdown

The version of Markdown used in Issues appears to be outdated.

## Comments

### +1 Comments Auto Convert to a Reaction

Many people in comments under issues or pull requests are annoyed by the number of people still using the age-old technique of adding +1 in support.

GitHub has a feature of reacting with an emoji to the issue or pull request as a quick response mechanism.

The existing +1 comments should be converted to a thumbs up response and the comment removed with an advisory note.

GitHub should be able to stop +1 comments from occuring by adding a a function to the comment box which locates a lonely "+1" and stops the comment from being added with an overlay suggesting a reaction emoji to use.
