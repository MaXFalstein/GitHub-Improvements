# GitHub Labels and Milestones in JSON

I emailed GitHub to suggest implementing a JSON file in the .github configuration files for setting up the labels.

I have received emails from GitHub asking how I see this working. This is my file format suggestion for how it should look.

---

To add to the labels.json file, I have created a milestones.json file.

It features everything I think it needs to be able to configure the milestones with ease.

---

A default template should be uploadable to the account holder's settings for the labels.json and milestones.json files to be set as defaults every time there is a new repository created by that account.

The same should be supported for Companies and Organisations.
