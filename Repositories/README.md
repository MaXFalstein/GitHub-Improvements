### User profile pictures in miniature next to the file

The main three (default - configurable) contributors will feature to the left of the modification date.

This is toggled by keystroke and by a switch in the settings of the user.

This could be done with a JSON file in settings for all repositories.

[An example JSON file is given here](https://github.com/MaXwellFalstein/GitHub-Improvements/blob/master/Repositories/repo-contrib-pic.json).
